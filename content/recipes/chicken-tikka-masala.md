## The Story Behind the Dish

Chicken Tikka Masala is often called Britain's national dish, and its origins are hotly debated. Some say it was invented in Glasgow, others claim it's an adaptation of butter chicken from Delhi. Wherever it came from, it's become a beloved classic worldwide.

> "Tikka Masala is the perfect example of fusion cuisine done right – familiar yet exotic, comforting yet exciting."

## The Secret to Restaurant-Quality Flavor

The key to authentic tikka masala is the charred, smoky flavor from grilling or broiling the marinated chicken. This step cannot be skipped! The slight char adds depth that you simply can't get from pan-cooking alone.

### Marination Tips

*   **Time is your friend**: The longer you marinate, the more tender and flavorful the chicken becomes. Overnight is ideal.
*   **Use chicken thighs**: They stay juicier than breasts and won't dry out during cooking.
*   **Don't skip the yogurt**: The acid tenderizes the meat while the spices penetrate deeply.

## Building Layers of Flavor

The sauce is built in layers:

1.  **Aromatics**: Onions cooked until sweet and golden
2.  **Spice bloom**: Garam masala toasted to release essential oils
3.  **Tomato base**: Creates the foundational flavor
4.  **Cream**: Adds richness and balances the spices

## Customization Options

**Spice Level**: Adjust the cayenne pepper to your taste. For mild, use 1/4 tsp. For extra hot, go up to 1 tsp.

**Vegetarian Version**: Replace chicken with paneer cheese, cauliflower, or chickpeas. Skip the broiling step and simply simmer in the sauce.

**Dairy-Free**: Use coconut milk instead of cream and coconut yogurt for marinating.

## What to Serve With

*   **Basmati Rice**: The classic accompaniment, fluffy and fragrant
*   **Naan Bread**: Perfect for scooping up every last bit of sauce
*   **Raita**: Cool cucumber yogurt to balance the heat
*   **Pickled Onions**: Adds brightness and crunch

## Make-Ahead Tips

This dish actually tastes better the next day! The flavors meld and deepen overnight. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

To reheat, warm gently on the stove with a splash of water or cream to maintain the creamy consistency.
