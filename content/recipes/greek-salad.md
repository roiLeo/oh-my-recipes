## The True Horiatiki

An authentic Greek salad, or *horiatiki*, is a celebration of simplicity. Unlike American versions, it contains no lettuce—just chunky vegetables, briny olives, and a generous slab of feta cheese, all dressed with excellent olive oil and oregano.

> "In Greece, a salad is not a side dish. It's a way of life." - Greek proverb

## The Importance of Quality Ingredients

Since this salad has so few components, each one must shine:

*   **Tomatoes**: Use the ripest, most flavorful tomatoes you can find. Summer heirlooms are ideal.
*   **Feta**: Get authentic Greek feta made from sheep's milk or a sheep-goat blend. It's creamier and more flavorful than cow's milk versions.
*   **Olive Oil**: This is not the place for cheap oil. Use your best extra virgin olive oil—preferably Greek!
*   **Olives**: Kalamata olives are traditional, but any good quality Greek olive works.

## The Feta Debate

In Greece, the feta is typically placed as a whole block on top of the salad, not crumbled throughout. Diners break off pieces as they eat. This keeps the cheese from getting soggy and allows everyone to get as much or as little as they prefer.

However, if you prefer, you can crumble it—just do so right before serving!

## No Lettuce? Really?

Authentic Greek salad never contains lettuce. The idea is to showcase the vegetables in their pure form, not bulk up the salad with greens. The juices from the tomatoes, combined with olive oil and vinegar, create a delicious dressing that pools at the bottom of the bowl—perfect for soaking up with crusty bread.

## Serving Suggestions

Greek salad is incredibly versatile:

*   **As a meal**: Serve with warm pita bread and hummus for a light lunch
*   **With grilled meats**: Perfect alongside souvlaki, gyros, or grilled fish
*   **Meze spread**: Part of a larger Mediterranean feast with dolmades, tzatziki, and spanakopita

## The Perfect Pairing

Serve this salad with:

*   Fresh crusty bread for sopping up the juices
*   A glass of crisp white wine or ouzo
*   Grilled lamb chops or chicken
*   Marinated octopus or calamari

## Make It Ahead?

This salad is best assembled just before serving to prevent the vegetables from releasing too much liquid. However, you can prep all the ingredients ahead of time and store them separately. Assemble and dress right before eating for maximum crunch and freshness.

## Regional Variations

Different regions of Greece have their own touches:

*   **Crete**: Often adds *dakos* (barley rusks) soaked in tomato juice
*   **Santorini**: Uses local cherry tomatoes and caper leaves
*   **Thessaloniki**: Sometimes includes capers alongside the olives

No matter the variation, the spirit remains the same: fresh, simple, and utterly delicious.
